# The Urban Tool

	u2l is a gentoo "distribution" aimed at providing a sysadmin tool thats

	1. already setup the way @askdonjohn and/or you wants
	2. easy to deploy
	3. selfupdating
	4. customizeable

## The Start

	u2l is [atm] a script that installs gentoo with custom pkgs and 
	basic configuration files.

## The Goal

	A fully fledged gentoo distribution
